I worked as a software engineering intern at Accion Systems during my high school junior summer. 

[Accion Systems](https://www.accion-systems.com/) is a startup that produces ion thruster chip technology for micro-satellite propulsion. I was lucky enough to work as an intern here during my junior summer of high school.

The specifics of my project are under NDA, but as an overview, I helped Accion build low-level software that would allow them to reprogram their thruster chips floating in orbit from the ground. I also improved the custom data processing GUI they used to analyze testing data.

During my internship, I had to learn a lot on the fly: microcontrollers, UART, assembly, as well as familiarizing myself with python scientific librares (numpy, pandas) and GUI libraries (tKinter)
