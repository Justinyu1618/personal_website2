<h2 class="text-uppercase">MIT Infolab</h2>
<h4> 2018 - Present</h4>
<p class="item-intro text-muted">Current undergraduate researcher at MIT CSAIL, pursuing projects in improving question-answering systems through NLP models.</p>
<h4><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/" target="_blank">The Infolab</a></h4>
<p>The Infolab is one of the labs located in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The primary work of the Infolab is to investigate “natural language and visual perception in different contexts from how it is learned, to how it is grounded in visual perception, all the way to how machines can readily interact with humans.” Many of the projects utilize a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tools, with a unique desire to combine classical AI and machine learning. </p>
<br>
<h4>Current Research Work</h4>
<p>My current research project focuses on using recently developed sequence models and other machine learning tools to improve the performance of question-answering systems, such as Infolab’s START system. Much of the information retrieved from knowledge bases such as Wikipedia can be stored in triples of the format (Subject, Relationship, Object).</p>

<p> My task is to develop various sequence models to generate natural language questions given a triple of information i.e. (Obama, Spouse, Michelle) → “Obama’s wife is Michelle”. With these automatically generated questions, START will be able to better answer real human questions about these subjects. </p>
<br>
<p>I also built a web platform for creating written annotations for educational videos. These annotations are fed into START’s knowledge base, along with the transcript of the video, so that users are able to ask context questions about specific videos. The hope of this project is to apply automated question answering systems to MOOCs and educational platforms.</p>
