Just a fun side project I made with friends. 

We created a fully distributed terminal based arcade, which can automatically detect other computers on your network and connect to them to play games, fully inside the terminal.

The system is built on a custom implementation of the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm (dear god never do this again) for coordinating game state. 

We've only implemented the game Tron so far.
