In 6th grade, a group of friends and I decided to create a “Tacit Glove” to help a blind student in our grade navigate the halls.

The "Tacit Glove" was inspired by something we saw in an issue of MAKE magazine that we wanted to recreate. It's a device that is worn on the hand equipped with ultrasonic sensors in the front and motors in the back for haptic feedback when navigating an environment.

We worked on it for a year and presented it to our blind friend. Though not a perfect solution, it was exciting to be able to create technology that could help make someone's life easier. This was my first real technology-related project, and it inspired me to pursue my passion for using technology to solve important problems.

Later, we expanded the idea to using wearable technologies like Google Glass as a platform for helping the visually impaired navigate, leading me and my friends to found Auxivision.
