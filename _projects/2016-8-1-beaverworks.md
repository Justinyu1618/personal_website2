In the summer of 2016, 45 students from around the country were invited to participate in BWSI, a program to teach advanced autonomous robotics to high school students.

MIT Beaverworks Summer Institute was a residential summer program at MIT where we learned the fundamentals of robotics, control theory, planning algorithms and more.

Throughout the program, we:
* Completed various technical challenges, worked with the RACECAR platform, using LIDAR, camera and IMU sensor input.
* Learned to use software such as ROS and Gazebo to program more complex robots.
* Implemented a PID controller, a potential field path planning algorithm and SLAM.
* Used computer vision to detect and recognize colors and objects.

The four weeks culiminated in a final race between all teams, where my team won 2nd place.

MIT Beaverworks Summer Institute was amazing, and gave me experience working with the kinds of sensors and hardware that would be implemented in the real robotics industry. It also heightened my interest in robotics and technology.
