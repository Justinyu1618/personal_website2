This was my intern project during my summer interning at [Dexai Robotics](https://www.dexai.com/), a robotics food automation startup. I worked mainly on robot safety features, including a controlled emergency stop for the robot and designing a system of cameras for detecting and localizing humans in the workspace using MaskRCNN and computer vision. 

Here's a demo video of my intern project:

Here's me experimenting with my detection system:

Fun fact: My intern project got a small shoutout in a video on the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08j3mbq) :)
