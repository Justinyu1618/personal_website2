### Motivation
HackMIT receives several thousand applications every year. As an organizer of HackMIT, I wanted to create a platform that would streamline the application reading process, automatically record and manage the scoring of these apps, and track the progress of indivduals throughout the app reading process

#### Tools Used
Frontend: Semantic UI and React \\
Backend: Flask server with PostgreSQL database
