Hey! I'm a student at MIT '22 studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Linguistics.

I'm currently building the metaverse at [Gather Town](https://gather.town/){:target="blank"}!

Last summer I was a research intern in the Applied Deep Learning Team @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-ix/){:target="blank"}. Last summer I worked on computer vision and controls for chef robots @ [Dexai Robotics](https://www.dexai.com/){:target="blank"}. I'm also doing natural language processing research at the [MIT CS and AI Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="blank"}, working on sim2real transfers for natural language instructions.

On campus, I ran the [HackMIT Dev team](https://www.notion.so/Join-HackMIT-Dev-8484e088859640e0a0b5af1a4ddbec4d){:target="blank"}, writing and maintaining [open source](https://code.hackmit.org/){:target="blank"} web apps for organizing hackathons. I'm also part of the Machine Intelligence Community, Asian Dance Team, and Î˜ Îž.

In high school, I founded [my own hackathon](https://mahacks.com/){:target="blank"} in the Boston area and worked on various project ventures including using Google Glass to help the visually impaired. I also [advocated](https://winchester.wickedlocal.com/news/20161217/winchester-students-speak-at-massachusetts-stem-summit){:target="blank"} for entrepreneurial + STEM education and currenty serve on the board of directors for [Youth CITIES](http://youthcities.org/){:target="blank"}, an entrepreneurship education non-profit.

I like attending hackathons for fun and I'm always working on personal projects.
When I'm not coding, I'm probably climbing buildings, dancing or playing piano.

I also love talking to new people so come say ðŸ‘‹: justinyu [at] mit.edu
