Hey! I'm a student at MIT '22 studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Linguistics.

This summer I will be a research intern in the Applied Deep Learning Team @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-ix/). Last summer I worked on computer vision and controls for chef robots @ [Dexai Robotics](https://www.dexai.com/). I'm also doing natural language processing research at the [MIT CS and AI Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), currently working on sim2real transfers for natural language instructions.

On campus, I run the [HackMIT Dev team](https://www.notion.so/Join-HackMIT-Dev-8484e088859640e0a0b5af1a4ddbec4d), writing and maintaining [open source](https://code.hackmit.org/) web apps for organizing hackathons. I'm also part of the Machine Intelligence Community, Asian Dance Team, and Θ Ξ.

In high school, I founded [my own hackathon](https://mahacks.com/) in the Boston area and worked on various project ventures including using Google Glass to help the visually impaired. I also [advocated](https://winchester.wickedlocal.com/news/20161217/winchester-students-speak-at-massachusetts-stem-summit) for entrepreneurial + STEM education and currenty serve on the board of directors for [Youth CITIES](http://youthcities.org/), an entrepreneurship education non-profit. 


I like attending hackathons for fun and I'm always working on personal projects. 
When I'm not coding, I'm probably climbing buildings, dancing or playing piano.
