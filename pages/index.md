Hey! I'm a student at MIT '22 studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Linguistics.

This summer I will be a research intern in the Applied Deep Learning Team @ NVIDIA. Last summer I worked on computer vision and controls for chef robots @ Dexai Robotics. I'm also doing natural language processing research at the MIT CS and AI Lab (CSAIL), currently working on sim2real transfers for natural language instructions.

On campus, I run the HackMIT Dev team, writing and maintaining open source web apps for organizing hackathons. I'm also part of the Machine Intelligence Community, Asian Dance Team, and Θ Ξ.

In high school, I founded my own hackathon in the Boston area and worked on various project ventures including using Google Glass to help the visually impaired. I also advocated for entrepreneurial + STEM education and currenty serve on the board of directors for Youth CITIES, an entrepreneurship education non-profit. 


I like attending hackathons for fun and I'm always working on personal projects. 
When I'm not coding, I enjoy climbing, dancing, reading and playing piano.
