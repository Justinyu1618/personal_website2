Hey, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building the future of remote work at [Gather Town](https://gather.town/){:target="blank"}!

Previously, I was an ML research intern at NVIDIA working on [body pose estimation](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/training-optimizing-2d-pose-estimation-model-with-tao-toolkit-part-1/){:target="blank"} models for health care applications (i.e patient monitoring). I also worked on computer vision and controls for chef robots at [Dexai Robotics](https://www.dexai.com/){:target="blank"}. I graduated MIT '22 studying EECS.

While at MIT, I did NLP research at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="blank"}, working on fact verification, sim2real transfers for natural language instructions, and [split learning](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/distributed-learning-and-collaborative-learning-1/overview/){:target="blank"}.

On campus, I ran the [HackMIT Dev team](https://www.notion.so/Join-HackMIT-Dev-8484e088859640e0a0b5af1a4ddbec4d){:target="blank"}, writing and maintaining [open source](https://code.hackmit.org/){:target="blank"} web apps for organizing hackathons.

In high school, I founded [my own hackathon](https://mahacks.com/){:target="blank"} in the Boston area and worked on various projects including using Google Glass to help the visually impaired. I also [advocated](https://winchester.wickedlocal.com/news/20161217/winchester-students-speak-at-massachusetts-stem-summit){:target="blank"} for entrepreneurial + STEM education and currenty serve on the board of directors for [Youth CITIES](http://youthcities.org/){:target="blank"}, an entrepreneurship education non-profit.

I like attending hackathons for fun and I'm always working on personal projects.
When I'm not coding, I'm probably climbing buildings, working out, playing piano, or trying to get better at [Go](https://online-go.com/player/1234735/){:target="blank"}.

I also love talking to new people so come say hi: justinyu [at] mit.edu
