Take the dot product between the direction you want to go in life and your daily actions, habits, work, and thoughts. This is a measure of how focused you are. The larger the product, the more your actions align with your goals.

This is applicable even if you don't know what your goals are. Your actions are fixed, they're history, but your goal is undetermined. You can take the dot product against a number of possible goals and see what gets you the highest result.

My dot product is currently scattered. I don't think it's particularly high for any of my candidate goals.

You don't have to fail a single time to fail overall. A likely worst case is working many years on various different problems with no single direction. What do you build in the end? Your path length may be long but the distance you traveled is minuscule in any direction.
