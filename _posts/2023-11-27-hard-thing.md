Coming out of college, I had the mindset that I needed to start an "easy" company (i.e. B2B Saas), get rich, make connections, and then I could go off and start the type of company I actually wanted which would likely be a significantly harder company.

This feeling was informed by an observation that so many successful entrepreneurs start off with B2B Saas, create an industry giant, and then eventually have the resources to pursue something hard like space travel, fusion, or [humanoid robots](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettadcock/).

In the past year, I've gotten advice from several people on why this is bad.

##### The "easy" company is not easy

I've always viewed B2B Saas as the easy path. If I just built the next generation HR software, hiring platform, or Plaid for X niche industry, I could make millions in 3 years and move on.
Nope.
No company is really easy. The 3 year successes do exist but they're rare and you have to get really lucky. Any company you start should be treated like 5 - 10 year commitment at least. Plus, any "easy" company I could start will have hundreds of competitors, started by similar people with similar motivations.

If I had to dedicate the next 10 years to a company, shouldn't it be the thing I _actually_ want to do?

##### Progressing as you fail

Startups fail all the time. Even the most opportune market with strong tailwinds, a growing TAM, and high paying customers will yield many more failures than successful startups.

Each time you fail at a startup, you learn something. However, whether your failure adds to your life's progress all depends on how aligned your failures are with your end goal.

If I failed at 3 B2B Saas companies and then tried to go work on nuclear fusion, I might as well have started from scratch 10 years earlier. However, if I failed at 3 health tech startups, and then go work on medical devices -- all of the industry knowledge, operational experience, and connections I gained will only serve as tailwinds for my next venture.

It's important to **align my failures to my ultimate goal**. If what I'm doing will add progress towards my end goal whether I succeed or fail, does failure even exist?

##### Easy companies are boring

Easy companies are the companies in the latest YC batch that you look at and think "wait, doesn't this exist already". In fact, it probably already does within that very YC batch.

Easy companies are boring, not only to work on as a founder but also as an early employee. The best engineers, designers, and PMs are looking for a vision to work on. That's honestly why I think the early team at Gather was so phenomenal.

Sam Altman raised a similar sentiment in a [talk](https://startups.joinperch.com/q/sam-altman-explains-why-founders-should-start-the-hard-company-now-da711a74?perchObject=Video) he gave
