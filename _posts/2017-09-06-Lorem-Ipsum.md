My journey into the fungal jungle

## Science

> [!Note]
> This [Andrew Huberman Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIxVfln02Ss&t=3771s&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman) is a really good deep dive into the neurological effects of psilocybin

##### Papers

### Tips For Taking Shrooms

- Don't eat for at least 4 hours before the trip
- If the goal is to rewire your thought processes, you should mostly keep your eyes closed
- Have music queued up to listen to. [Music is not just a feature of the setting](https://youtu.be/eIxVfln02Ss?t=2672), it drives your trips

##### Dosage

- 0.5g - 1g is micro-dosing
- 1g - 3g is light dosing
- 3g - 5g is heavy dosing
- 3.5 grams is a heavy dose for me

> 1 gram of shrooms corresponds to ~10 mg of Psilocybin

## Experiences

2023-10-28: [[Reflection on First Shrooms Experience]]

- I took shrooms for the first time with Willers and Daniel
- I took way too much and ended up in a bad state at the end
- I should be more careful in the future

2023-11-19: Tried taking a small dose

- Took 0.8 grams with a friend
- Actually had a really fun and chill time. It felt like having had about 3 or 4 drinks
- I think I'm going to quit alcohol. If I don't want to be sober some time, maybe I'll just take a small amount of shrooms
  - I feel like this is definitely healthier than 3 drinks of alcohol
